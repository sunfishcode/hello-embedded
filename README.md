# Hello Embedded! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a sketch of an embedded API described in Wit,
and a simple example Wasm application that builds with it that blinks
an LED, and a Wasmtime-based simulator that can run it.

## The Wits

The API is described in Wit interfaces in the wit directory, and is based off
of the [embedded-hal] API.

## The guest

The example application is in the guest directory. Building it currently
requires a cargo component with [this patch] applied. Build with
`cargo component build`.

```sh
$ cd guest
$ cargo component build
[...]
$ cd ..
```

That produces a component in `guest/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/hello_embedded.wasm`.
We can examine it with `wasm-tools`:

```sh
$ wasm-tools component wit guest/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/hello_embedded.wasm
package root:component;

world root {
  import sketch:embedded/delay@0.0.0;
  import sketch:embedded/digital@0.0.0;

  export sketch:embedded/run@0.0.0;
}
```

Here we can see it's exporting the `run` interface, which has the `run`
entrypoint function, and importing the `digital` and `delay` and interfaces,
which it uses to set the led and control its speed, respectively.

## The host

Once the guest is built, the host can be run:
```sh
$ cd host
$ cargo run
[...]
```

## Bonus points

This example also demonstrates [Typed Main]. The `run` function takes
two handle arguments, providing the component with exactly what it
needs.
